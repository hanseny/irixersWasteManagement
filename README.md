Waste Management are the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. This includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management process.Nowadays its a biggest problem faced in our country due to which we have come up with this idea.


So here is the brief idea of the website,

1.Central Hub

2.Sub Central Hub

3.People


following are the features and the functions of each of attributes given above:-

1. Central Hub

This is the main centre which will collect all the waste,segregate and will be distributing it to

the agro-based companies(wet waste) and plastic recycling companies(dry waste).The Central

Hub would be doing segregation of the waste that will be collected from Sub-Centres.

Segregation of the waste is done by the labourers employed there.The Central Hub will be

having Tie-Ups done with the companies and MNCâ€™s.



2.Sub Central Hubs

These are the units which collects garbage from different areas. These units will be located close

to people so that people wont face any difficulty in distributing their waste.This garbage is

collected from people and its stored in a godown. Each unit will have its own transport vehicle

and that vehicle carries the waste and supply it to the central hub. A Sub-central hub will have a

manager who will keep track of records of the waste given by the people. Manager also will

update the daily status of the people who are giving the waste. This Sub-Centres will have

points system which will basically attract people towards it. People will be paid for the amount of

waste weights. Point system will be based on the amount of waste weight they give to the sub

-centres. This will decrease the amount of waste that is been done everyday by the society

Manager will update status of points earned by each one. He/She can also give money based on

the points earned by people. Only the Manager has the rights to change and modify people

details.



3.People

Waste is done everyday by each households. The waste can be distributed to the respected sub

centres by only the registered people. People can register anytime from the portal.They dont have

a compulsion of segregating the waste because its already done by Central-Hub. This system

encourage people to cooperate with the company and protect our environment. This system even

provides huge amount of employments even to those who are less educated. People are also

provided their login by which they can check their current status and balance.
